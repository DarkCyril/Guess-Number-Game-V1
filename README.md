   - **Easy:** 10 tries
   - **Medium:** 5 tries
   - **Hard:** 3 tries
3. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
4. The user makes guesses and receives feedback if the guess is:
   - Too high 
   - Too low 
   - Correct 
5. The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of tries.
